    <h3>This is not a Hamas soldier, this is not a Hamas sympathiser. This is a child who was bombed for being
      Palestinian. This is a child who was bombed for being in Rafah. He knows no October 13th, he knows no politics,
      all he knows is that he was in Rafah when a bombed dropped on his head. Blood on his hoodie that might not even be
      his, bandages on his head and face, the sheer fact that there is more blood in his eyes than tears. He is a child
      of a war he was not invovled in. Do not think this is ok, do not think that he is just a casualty of war, he is
      not a tragedy of war, his experiences is not a product of war. He could be your child, he could be anyone's child.
      Please think for a moment, look at everything that has happened up until this point. You will see this is not a
      war, this is a genocide. Please do not ignore this any longer. You can save these people while being thousands of
      miles away. <h1>Let them live.</h1>
